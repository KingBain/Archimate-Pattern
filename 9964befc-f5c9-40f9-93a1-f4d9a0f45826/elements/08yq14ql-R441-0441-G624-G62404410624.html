Risk assessments take into account threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and impact to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and Canada based on the operation and use of information systems. Risk assessments also take into account risk from external parties (e.g., service providers, contractors operating information systems on behalf of the organization, individuals accessing organizational information systems, outsourcing entities)Risk assessments (either formal or informal) can be conducted at all three tiers in the risk management hierarchy (i.e., organization level, mission/business process level, or information system level) and at any phase in the system development life cycle. Risk assessments can also be conducted at various steps in the Risk Management Framework of ITSG-33, including categorization, security control selection, security control implementation, security control assessment, information system authorization, and security control monitoring. RA-3 is noteworthy in that the control must be partially implemented prior to the implementation of other controls in order to complete the first two steps in the Risk Management Framework. Risk assessments can play an important role in security control selection processes, particularly during the application of tailoring guidance, which includes security control supplementation. Related controls: RA-2.</xmp> </td></tr><tr><td> Artifact Location </td><td> <xmp class="no-margin" style="white-space:pre-wrap"></xmp> </td></tr><tr><td> ISTG-33 Family Control Name </td><td> <xmp class="no-margin" style="white-space:pre-wrap">RISK ASSESSMENT</xmp> </td></tr><tr><td> ITSG-33 Control Reference </td><td> <xmp class="no-margin" style="white-space:pre-wrap">CSE ITSG-33 Annex 2 Information System Security Risk Management Activities [Reference 58].
